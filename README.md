# BAT Tool Storage
This repository is a repository for various tools etc. created with `.bat` and `.cmd` (In the future, we may also include `.ps1`).
<br>Here you'll find useful scripts, emergency scripts, garbage scripts, and more.

# Explanation
Most of the BAT files in this repository do not provide instructions, with some exceptions.

# Why we have this repository
Because uploading to separate repositories creates more "garbage" repositories.
